Pythonic refactor of the OpenGL Redbook example source (http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/redbook/).

As of fall 2011, this project is just getting underway in my free time. I've made write access public, so feel free
to contribute.

I'm trying to keep the class structure as simple as possible for now. Once all the files are working in python,
I'll eliminate all duplication, hopefully creating an obvious and useful set of classes for working with GLUT.
